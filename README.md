# Semantic Book Recommender

- Leveraged OpenAI API and HuggingFace models to generate text embeddings and perform zero-shot classification, enabling semantic understanding and dynamic categorization of book genres without labeled training data.
- Utilized LangChain to streamline the recommendation pipeline, integrating embedding workflows, vector search operations, and dynamic prompt management for context-aware results.
- Implemented a scalable vector database (Chroma) to efficiently store, index, and retrieve embeddings, powering rapid similarity searches across large datasets.
- Conducted sentiment analysis and emotion extraction using LLMs to interpret user queries and book reviews, tailoring recommendations to align with emotional tone and preferences.
- Deployed a Gradio web interface for natural-language input, delivering visually structured recommendations with real-time responsiveness.
